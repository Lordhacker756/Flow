## What I Learned Building FLOW

While building FLOW, I learned the importance of maintaining a proper folder structure, using TypeScript and splitting screens into simple modules, and separating styles in separate TypeScript modules.

## Features

### User Authentication

FLOW provides multiple options for user authentication, including email, Google, and phone number. Users can select their preferred method to sign up and log in to the app.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `react-native run-android` to run the app on an Android device, or `react-native run-ios` to run the app on an iOS device.

## Conclusion
